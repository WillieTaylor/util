Briefly, the naccess program calculates the atomic accessible surface defined
by rolling a probe of given size around a van der Waals surface. This program
is an implimentation of the method of Lee and Richards (1971) J.Mol.Biol.55,
379-400. which does just that. The program is dimensioned for up to 20000
atoms, and allows the variation of the probe size and atomic radii by the user.
The program is written in (fairly) standard FORTRAN 77 and should compile
on most UNIX platforms. It outputs 3 files: 

1) An atomic accessibility file (.asa file) containing the calculated
accessible surface for each atom in a PDB file, as well as the assigned van der
Waal radii.

2) A residue accessibility (.rsa) file containing summed atomic accessible
surface areas over each protein residue, as well as the relative accessibility
of each residue calculated as the %accessiblity compared to the accessibility
of that residue type in an extended ALA-x-ALA tripeptide. See Hubbard, Campbell
& Thornton (1991) J.Mol.Biol.220,507-530. You can prevent this file from being
calculated if you don't need it.

3) A log file (.log) containing information concerning the calculation.

installation
------------
If you are reading this file you may have already done it ! You should
have the following files in your installation directory:

README          accall.f        standard.data   
install.scr     naccess.scr     vdw.radii

next just type "csh install.scr", and the program should be compiled
for you, and then final script that runs everything should be "naccess"

usage
-----
The program is run by a script called "naccess". At installation, the script
is aliased to the command "naccess", but you should create your own alias, and
include it in your .cshrc or some other script if you want to use the program
regularly. Something of the form:

alias naccess '/home/username/naccess_directory/naccess'

To use the program, simply type "naccess", and the name of a valid PDB file,
including the full path where appropriate. There are a number of other
parameters that can be supplied, but in its simplest form, it might be
something like:

naccess /data/pdb/1crn.brk

and would produce the files:

1crn.asa 1crn.log 1crn.rsa

The full usage is:
naccess pdb_file -p probe_size -r vdw_radii_file -s std_data_file -z zslice -[hwyfac]"
NOTE: use multiple options separately, ie: naccess test.pdb -p 1.20 -h -f -a

The default probe size is 1.40 Angstroms. To use a probe of size 1.20 A type: 

naccess /data/pdb/1crn.brk -p 1.2

If you don't want to use the default van der Waal radii, taken from Chothia
(1976) J.Mol.Biol.105,1-14, then you copy the file "vdw.radii" to another file
and edit the values appropraitely. Then you can type:

naccess /data/pdb/1crn.brk -r my.radii

If you supply a file which doesn't exist, the program will default to the
vdw.radii file. It looks for it first in the current directory, then the
naccess executable directory, and then gives up !!

The Lee and Richards method works by taking thin Z-slices through the molecule
and calculating the exposed arc lengths for each atom in each slice, and then
summing the arc lengths to the final area over all z-values. Hence, the zslice
parameter controls accuracy and also speed of calculation. The default value is
0.05 A, but can be changed. For rough, quick calculations, a value of 0.1 might
be better. You can type:

naccess /data/pdb/1crn.brk -z 0.1

As a rough estimate, the program takes about 8 secs (real time) for crambin
(1crn) using the default parameters on an IRIS Indigo workstation. Thats less
than 2 cpu seconds.

By default, the program ignores HETATM records, hydrogens, and waters. If you
want these to be considered in the calculation supply a parameter of the form 
-h, -w and/or -y respectively. You can type:

naccess /data/pdb/5pti.brk -y 

  or

naccess /data/pdb/4pti.brk -w 

  or

naccess /data/pdb/4hhb.brk -h

to see the effect of these parameters on the output files.

If you require atomic *contact* areas rather than accessible areas - this
is not the path traced by the probe centroid but the parts of the vdw surface
that the probe actually touches - then use the -c option:

naccess /data/pdb/4pti.brk -c 

NOTE: The relative accessibilities (see .rsa files below) will be incorrect if
you use this option. You can relcalulate them as contact areas if you wish 
with standard ala-x-ala tripeptides, and create a new "standard.data" type 
file to rectify this. I have the data for this if required - just send email.

Apart from HEME groups, the van der Waals radii are not explicitly defined in
the default vdw.radii file. You should add your own in if there are other
HETATM groups you are explicitly interested in. Otherwise the program makes
crude guesses at the respective radii !!

The .rsa residue accessibility file is created using the file "standard.data"
to calculate the percentage accessibilities. If these are unsatisfactory, edit
them. Again, the program looks in the current directory for this file, and then
the naccess executable directory. You can supply an alternative file using the
-s option, which works like the -r option for van der Waals radii.

example output files
--------------------

The first 2 residues from an example .asa file are shown below. The output
format is PDB, with B-factors and occupancies removed, then atomic accessiblity
in square Angstroms, followed by the assigned van der Waal radius. If you
want to keep the occupancies and B-factors in, then use the -f option (full)
which gives a slightly different (and larger) output format, but is compatible
with the hydrogen bond calculation program HBPLUS from Ian McDonald.

The beginning and end of an example .rsa file are shown below. The data is
summed over residues, and split into 5 classes. Total (all atoms), Non Polar
Sidechain (all non-oxygens and non-nitrogens in the sidechain), Polar Sidechain
(all oxygens and nitrogens in the sidechain), total sidechain, and
mainchain. For our purposes, alpha carbons are classed as sidechain atoms, so
that glycine can have a sidechain accessibility. They are therefore not
included in the mainchain. For each class, two values are given, an absolute
(ABS) and relative (REL) accessibility. The absolute value is the simple sum,
whilst the REL value is the % relative accessiblity. Absolute sums over the
whole chain are also given.

To avoid calculating and producing such a summary file, supply the program
with the -a option, which speeds things up very slightly.
